% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{question}[1. Review Questions]
\end{question}
\begin{solution}

\textbf{(3)}
"A model is, basically, a simplification of a particular part or feature of the world. 
Modeling is essential and inseparable part of any scientific activity. Models illustrate
the essence of the real object it is designed to resemble. Maybe without noticing it, we also
use models when thinking about a problem; there is always an implicit model." 
(pg.$10$ from the lecture II slides) 

\smallskip

\textbf{(4)}
Simplification is an important part of modelling because it help us
"to dispense with irrelevant details and to focus on the important connections." 
(pg.$10$ from the lecture II slides)
\smallskip

\textbf{(5)}
Economics use math, because math "gives precision and structure to our thinking." (pg.17 
from the lecture II slides)

\begin{question}[3. Utility function]
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
\textbf{(1)} We claim that preferences are strictly monotonic with respect to $z$ and $s$.
Taking the partials with respect to $z$ and $s$, we obtain
\eQb
\dfrac{\partial U}{\partial z} &=& \dfrac{\alpha}{2} z^{-\frac{1}{2}}, \\
\dfrac{\partial U}{\partial s} &=& \dfrac{1 - \alpha}{2} s^{-\frac{1}{2}}. \\
\eQe
As $\alpha \in (0,1)$, we see that both partials are strictly positive for all positive
values of $z$ and $s$, which is the domain of interest in this case. Hence, we have shown
that the preferences are strictly monotonic with respect to $z$ and $s$. Note 
that strict monotonicity implies monotonicity as well.

\pagebreak

\textbf{(2)} 
The following figure contains the graphs of indifference curves for the 
corresponding utility levels $\bar{U} = 1, 5, 10$ with $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{2}$.

\textbf{(3)} 
Yes, the marginal utility is decreasing. Evaluating the second-order partials
from the first-order partials obtained in part $(1)$, we get
\eQb
\dfrac{\partial^2 U}{\partial z^2} &=& -\dfrac{\alpha}{4} z^{-\frac{3}{2}}, \\
\dfrac{\partial^2 U}{\partial s^2} &=& -\dfrac{1 - \alpha}{4} s^{-\frac{3}{2}}. \\
\eQe
As $\alpha \in (0,1)$, we see that for any positive values of $z$ and $s$, we have 
\eQb
\dfrac{\partial^2 U}{\partial z^2} & < & 0, \\
\dfrac{\partial^2 U}{\partial s^2} & < & 0. \\
\eQe
Therefore, we have shown that the marginal utility is decreasing with 
respect to both variables. It is, in fact,
strictly decreasing.

\smallskip

\textbf{(4)}
First, note that we have the following formula for the 
computation Marginal Rate of Substitution of $z$ for $s$ at bundle $(z,s)$:
\eQb
MRS_{\text{z for s}}(z,s) &=& \frac{\frac{\partial U}{\partial z}}{\frac{\partial U}{\partial s}}.
\eQe
Substituting the first-order partials computed previously, we obtain
\eQb
MRS_{\text{z for s}}(z,s) &=& \frac{\frac{a}{2}z^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{\frac{1-\alpha}{2}s^{-\frac{1}{2}}}.
\eQe
Substituting $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{2}$ and $(z,s) = (1,4)$ to the above equation and simplifying, we get
\eQb
MRS_{\text{z for s}}(1,4) &=& \frac{1^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{4^{-\frac{1}{2}}} = 2.
\eQe
This means that the consumer under consideration is ready to give up twice as much soda 
in exchange for pizza while maintaining the same level of utility.

\pagebreak

\textbf{(5)}
We solve the given maximization problem of the consumer by using the substitution method. 
Solving for $z$ in the constraint equation, we obtain
\eQb
z &=& \dfrac{m - p_s \cdot s }{p_z}.
\eQe
Substituting the above equation into the objective, we end up with the following 
maximization problem:
\eQb
\underset{ \{ s \} }{\text{max}} \> \dfrac{1}{2} (\dfrac{m - p_s \cdot s}{p_z})^{\frac{1}{2}} + 
\dfrac{1}{2}s^{\frac{1}{2}}. 
\eQe
Taking the first-order derivative with respect to $s$, we get
\eQb
\dfrac{\partial U}{\partial s} &=& \dfrac{1}{4}
\{ -p_s \cdot (\dfrac{m-p_s \cdot s}{p_z})^{\frac{-1}{2}} + s^{\frac{-1}{2}} \}
\eQe
